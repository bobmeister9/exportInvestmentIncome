# exportInvestmentIncome
Export investment income from Personal Capital.

To use this, log into personalcapital.com and select Overview/Transactions.  Select Investment and set the desired time range.  Then click the csv icon to export the transactions to a csv file and note the name and location.  Specify this file as the input and the desired output xlsx filename.

Note retirement contributions and transfers are excluded from the output since they are savings rather than income generated by the investments.
